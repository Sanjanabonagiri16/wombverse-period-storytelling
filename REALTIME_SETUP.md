## 🗄️ Database Setup Required

**IMPORTANT**: Before the real-time features can work, you need to set up your database tables.

### Step 1: Access Your Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: `zxcczifkldwuelhibbwm`
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Run the Database Setup Script
1. Copy the entire contents of `database-setup.sql` from your project
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
3. Click **Run** to execute the script
4. You should see: `"Database setup completed successfully!"`

### Step 3: Verify Tables Created
In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Table Editor** and verify these tables exist:
- ✅ `profiles`
- ✅ `stories`
- ✅ `reactions`
- ✅ `comments`
- ✅ `bookmarks`

## 🎨 Color Consistency

The application now uses a consistent color palette throughout:

### **Womb Color Palette**
- `womb-charcoal`: `#1a1a1a` (Near Black)
- `womb-crimson`: `#800000` (Dark Maroon)
- `womb-plum`: `#5C4033` (Dark Brown)

All components now use these consistent colors instead of generic Tailwind colors.
